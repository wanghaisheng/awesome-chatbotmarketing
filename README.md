>MobileMonkey is aimed squarely at non-technical users - its tagline is “Chatbots for Marketers - no coding required!” Despite this, it has some features that put it before other similar tools in terms of being able to build sophisticated behaviour.
An example of this is the ability to store the user’s response to a question in a variable. This can then be reused at any later point in your bot’s replies.
